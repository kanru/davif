## DAVIF

Decompress an [AVIF][] file to an image file.
As of 2020-05-31 only PNG format output is implemented.

I wrote this program to use it as a thumbnailer for Gnome desktop.
The commandline switch is compatiable with the `dwebp` utility for webp.

## Install

First install the binary

```sh
cargo install --root /usr davif
```

Then install the thumbnailer config

```txt
‚ùØ cat avif.thumbnailer 
[Thumbnailer Entry]
Exec=/usr/bin/davif %i -scale %s 0 -o %o
MimeType=image/x-avif;image/avif;
```

```sh
sudo install avif.thumbnailer /usr/share/thumbnailer
```
